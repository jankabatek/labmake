# labmake - automating the creation of value labels from codebook-style variables 

I made this script because I was getting tired of manually recoding Excel codebooks into Stata labels. 

To install, parse the following command in Stata:

    net install labmake, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jankabatek/labmake/master/ado/") replace

The help file contains further details and examples:

    help labmake
